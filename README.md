PROBLEM SHEET 2
1. Consider the integral

where 0 < ϵ ≪ 1. Show that

and hence, using the result  e−xxn dx = n! for n ∈ N0, that

where

By bounding |RN| above, deduce that

as ϵ → 0, i.e. that I(ϵ) ∼ (−1)nϵn(2n)!.
2. Show that the roots of the following cubic equations are as given, for 0 < ϵ ≪ 1.

are x = 1 + 2/3ϵ + . . ., x = −1 − 6/1ϵ + . . ., and x = 2 − 3/1ϵ + . . .;
(b) the roots of
x3 − (3 + ϵ)x − 2 + ϵ = 0,
are x = 2 + 9/1ϵ + . . . and x = −1 ± √2/3ϵ1/2 + . . .;
(c) the roots of
ϵx3 + x − 2 = 0
are x = 2 − 8ϵ + . . . and x = ±iϵ−1/2 + 1 + . . .; and
(d) the roots of
